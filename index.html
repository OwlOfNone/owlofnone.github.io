              Hey, my name is Lisa aka Owl of None and I am a 29 year old Content Creator located in Germany.
              As I was just working on my Phd title in Neurobiology, I decided it is time for a change.
              Somehow the basic idea of the internet inspires me: Sharing ideas and information with people from all around the world.
            </p>
            <p>
              That plus my endless curiosity made me want to explore this Freelance-Content-Creator thing!
              If you want to accompany me with that, you will find my social media sites in the box on top of the page.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the beginning I will experiment with different kinds of content on various social media platforms.
              My content represents all of my hobbies: ranging from world building, character design, societal issues like "How to live eco-friendly?" to some nerdy stuff like video games or programming.
            </p>
            <h3>Currently I am working on:</h3>
            <p>
              Right now I am focusing on setting up my small business, as well as improving some skills of mine and trying to create some nice content.
            </p>
            <p> Some of the current goals are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>creating my own website</li>
              <li>advancing my art skills</li>
              <li>looking into how to recycle paper myself</li>
              <li>learn how to edit videos to improve the quality of my content</li>
              <li>finding use for the skills I already have - like programming in Python</li>
            </ul>
