<h2>Privacy policy</h2>
<ol>
  <h3><li>General</li></h3>
  <ol>
    <h4><li>What is personal data<br></li></h4>
    <p>Personal data are information that discloses or can disclose the identity of the user. We adhere to the principle of data avoidance. As far as possible, we refrain from collecting personal data.</p>
    <h4><li>Handling of personal data<br></li></h4>
      <p>Your personal data will only be processed if we have received your consent to do so (Art. 6 (1 a) GDPR) or if the processing of the data is   necessary for our legitimate interests and insofar as the assessment shows that there are no overriding interests, fundamental rights or freedoms on your part (Art. 6 (1 f) GDPR). <br>
      We may use order processors to process your personal data but will not pass on the personal data to third parties beyond this as a matter of principle. <br>
      The processing of your personal data takes place exclusively within the EU, unless otherwise stated below</p>
      <h4><li>Usage data<br></li></h4>
      <p>When visiting the website, general technical information is collected. This is the IP address used, time, duration of the visit, browser type and, if applicable, the page of origin. This usage data is registered in a log file for technical reasons and can be used and stored for the purpose of statistical evaluation of this website. A linkage of these usage data with your further personal data does not take place.</p>
      <h4><li>Duration of storage<br></li></h4>
          <p>We store your personal data after the termination of the purpose for which the data was collected only as long as this is required by law (especially tax law).</p>
    </ol>
    <h3><li>Your rights</li></h3>
    <ol>
      <h4><li>Information<br></li></h4>
        <p>You can request information from us as to whether we are processing personal data about you. If so, you have a right to information about this personal data and the further information specified in Article 15 of the GDPR.</p>
      <h4><li>Right to rectification<br></li></h4>
        <p>SYou have the right to rectification of inaccurate personal data concerning you and may request the completion of incomplete personal data in accordance with Art. 16 GDPR.</p>
      <h4><li>Right to erasure<br></li></h4>
        <p>You have the right to demand that we delete the personal data concerning you without undue delay. We are obliged to delete them without delay, in particular, if one of the following reasons applies:<br>
          -	Your personal data is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected or otherwise processed. <br>
          -	You revoke your consent on which the processing of your data was based, and there is no other legal basis for the processing.<br>
          -	Your data has been processed unlawfully.</p>
        <p>The right to erasure does not exist insofar as your personal data is required for the assertion, exercise or defense of our legal claims.</p>
      <h4><li>Right to restriction of processing<br></li></h4>
        <p>You have the right to demand that we restrict the processing of your personal data if<br>
          -	you dispute the accuracy of the data, and we, therefore, verify the accuracy, <br>
          - the processing is unlawful, and you refuse the deletion and demand the restriction of use instead, <br>
          - we no longer need the data, but you need it to assert, exercise or defend legal claims,
          - you have objected to the processing of your data, and it has not yet been determined whether our legitimate reasons outweigh your reasons.</p>
      <h4><li>Right to data portability<br></li></h4>
        <p>You have the right to receive the personal data concerning you that you have provided to us in a structured, common and machine-readable format, and you have the right to transfer this data to another controller without hindrance from us, provided that the processing is based on consent or a contract and the processing is carried out by us with the help of automated processes.</p>
      <h4><li>Right of withdrawal<br></li></h4>
        <p>Insofar as the processing of your personal data is based on consent, you have the right to revoke this consent at any time.</p>
      <h4><li>General and right of appeal<br></li></h4>
        <p>The exercise of your above rights is generally free of charge for you. In the event of complaints, you have the right to directly contact the supervisory authority responsible for us, the State Data Protection Officer. </p>

          <p>This social media platform may process personal data outside the EU; in this respect, we refer to the aforementioned privacy policy of the social media platform.
          The respective social media platform may create usage profiles from your usage behavior and the resulting interests and actions on your part and store cookies on your computer in which your usage behavior is stored. If you have an account on the social media platform and are logged in, your usage behavior may even be stored independently of the device. Your user profile can be used, for example, to place advertisements that presumably correspond to your interests.
          <br>
          We process the personal data exclusively for communicating with you via the social media platform you have chosen and for optimizing our online presence and ensuring that no interests on your part are affected here that outweigh this legitimate interest on our part (Art. 6 (1 f) GDPR). Insofar as you have already given the respective operator of the social media platform effective consent to the corresponding data processing, the processing of your personal data will also be based on this consent (Art. 6 (1 a) GDPR). </p>
    <ol>
      <h3><li>Third-party services</li></h3>
      <ol>
        <h4><li>Social media links<br></li></h4>
        <p>We have our own social media pages with third-party providers that can be reached via links from this website. Using the links will take you to the respective websites of the third-party providers (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram). To avoid unnecessary data transfer, we recommend that you log out of the respective third-party provider before using a corresponding link, so that user profiles cannot be created by the third-party provider simply by using the link.</p>
        <h4><li>Google Web Fonts<br></li></h4>
          <p>We use so-called web fonts from Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland ("Google"), in order to be able to display a uniform font on our website. These are automatically stored in your browser cache when you call up one of our pages in order to enable the desired display. If your browser does not support the web fonts used, a standard font of your computer may be used. Here, no interests of the users are affected which outweighs this technical necessity (Art. 6 (1 f) GDPR). You can view Google's privacy policy here: https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/. Further information on Google Web Fonts can be found at https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq./p>
